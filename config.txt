This is the configuration file. Fill in, after each '>' character, dimensions in meters (input '0' for only one TBD size) and the percentage of g generated at the radius of each component using decimal numbers (input '1' for Earth gravity, '0' if the tube is coupled to the previous component of the assembly).


First, clockwise rotating assembly of the vessel:

Spheroid component:
	(internal, equatorial) radius: > 1800
	ratio: (equatorial radius over polar radius | input 1 for a sphere) > 2
	percentage of g to be generated at radius: > 1.2


Tube component:
	(internal) radius: > 290
	length: > 2500
	percentage of g to be generated at radius: > 0


Second, counter-clockwise rotating assembly of the vessel:

Ring component:
	(internal, outer) radius: > 1800
	thickness: > 400
	length: > 0
	Has interlink? (0 if welded to the tube it spins with, else 1) > 1
	(internal) radius of the tube it is connected to: > 290
	percentage of g to be generated at radius: > 1.2
