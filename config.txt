This is the configuration file. Fill in, after each '>' character, dimensions in meters (input '0' for only one TBD size, which cannot be a radius and must be expressed in meters) and the percentage of g generated at the radius of each component using decimal numbers (input '1' for Earth gravity, '0' if the tube is coupled to the previous component of the assembly).


First, clockwise rotating assembly of the vessel:

Spheroid component:
	(internal, equatorial) radius: > 
	ratio: (equatorial radius over polar radius | input 1 for a sphere) > 
	percentage of g to be generated at radius: > 


Tube component:
	(internal) radius: > 
	length: > 
	percentage of g to be generated at radius: > 


Tube component:
	(internal) radius: > 
	length: > 
	percentage of g to be generated at radius: > 


Second, counter-clockwise rotating assembly of the vessel:

Ring component:
	(internal, outer) radius: > 
	thickness: > 
	length: > 
	Has interlink? (0 if welded to the tube it spins with, else 1) > 
	(internal) radius of the tube it is connected to: > 
	percentage of g to be generated at radius: > 


Ring component:
	(internal, outer) radius: > 
	thickness: > 
	length: > 
	Has interlink? (0 if welded to the tube it spins with, else 1) > 
	(internal) radius of the tube it is connected to: > 
	percentage of g to be generated at radius: >
